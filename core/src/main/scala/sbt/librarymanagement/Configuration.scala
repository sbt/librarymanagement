/*
Configuration isn't defined with Contraband.

The reasons that block it from being made a Contraband type (AFAIK):
 * its hashCode is a val, not a def
 * it doesn't have companion apply methods, but "of" instead

Other reasons that I don't think are blocking:
 * it's constructor is private[sbt] (doesn't matter, Configuration.of is public)

Reasons that are definitely not blocking:
 * it has a custom toString, supported by Contraband
 * it has init requirements, supported by Contraband via parent class
 * it has other methods, supported by Contraband via parent class
